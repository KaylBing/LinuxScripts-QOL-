# LinuxScripts-QOL #

These are some scripts that I have made that I found helpful on my linux machine.
A lot of them are useful for coding through the command line, and other similar
tasks. Some of them are also templates that I think many could find conceptually
useful. Best of luck, and I hope you find these useful.
